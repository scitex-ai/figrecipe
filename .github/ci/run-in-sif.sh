# Runs INSIDE the reused scitex-ci SIF (apptainer exec). $1 = python version.
#
# WHY a layered install (not the bare PYTHONPATH=src trick scitex-dev uses):
# the shared ci-cpu.sif bakes scitex-dev[all,dev] DEPS, NOT figrecipe's —
# matplotlib / graphviz / seaborn / django / Pillow / networkx / playwright /
# pytesseract / scitex-app / scitex-ui are absent from the SIF. So we install
# THIS checkout + its [all,dev] extras (WITH dependency resolution) into a
# writable --target dir and prepend that on PYTHONPATH. The SIF still supplies
# the heavy shared base (pip/uv, the python interpreters, scitex-dev's deps),
# so only figrecipe's own thin dep set is fetched per run.
#
# --target (not a plain `-e .`): the SIF's /opt/venv-* are root-owned + RO and
# the HPC compute-node HOME is RO inside the container, so a normal site install
# fails Permission denied. A writable target on node-local /tmp sidesteps both.
#
# Fail-loud: a missing interpreter or a failed install is a hard error.
